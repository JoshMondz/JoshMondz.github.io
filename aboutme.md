### Who am I?

My name is Josh Mondzelewski. I am a current student at Middlebury College studying Neuroscience. My plan is to go to med school after college and I hope to pursue a career in psychiatry. I have three siblings. My older sister is 23 and is currently an officer of the Navy stationed out in San Diego. My younger brother is 16 and just learned how to drive. My younger sister is 11 and currently swims and plays softball. 

### My Story

I was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 28, 2003. From there my family and I have moved to many places (including China!) but eventually settled in Nashville, Tennessee when I was 8 where we are currently living now. 

### My Interests and Hobbies

- I am currently playing football for Middlebury College. I play offensive line and I am currently going into my third year

- A hobby of mine that was sparked due to football is weightlifting. I really enjoy lifting and staying active outside of football.

- My day and I share a love for computer science and robots and we would work together on building and programming different robots. My favorite was a 3d printed robot that could solve a Rubikâ€™s cube.

- I also enjoy playing video games and use it as a way to stay connected with my friends from home.

### Fun Facts

- I have two different colored eyes with one being green and another being brown.

- I lived in China when I was younger and that is where my family adopted my little brother.
