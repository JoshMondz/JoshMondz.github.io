This is an example of a simple blog post about any topic. In it I've included a title picture as well as a few other things.

This assignment has taught me a good bit about markdown and Jekyll and how they do not always agree with each other. So below I am going to list a few tips that I caught onto that should make creating a website easier.

- In markdown, bullet points are indicated by a star "*". But with beautiful  Jekyll, bullet points are indicated with a dash "-". If you dont use a dash, jekyll will not understand and your webpage will be in a plain html style

- The "preview" box does not work the same as in RMarkdown since the preview will show a reqular html box. You sort of just need to trust the process and add, commit, and push a lot

- This goes along with the previous bullet but images are very specific and preview will not show your images even if you have the path correct. Once again this will just take a lot of adding, commiting, and pushing.
